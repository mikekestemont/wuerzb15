    "Burrows's Delta is a well-known attribution algorithm in the field. While Burrows originally did not situate his technique in the field of Machine Learning, Argamon later showed that his Delta measure could be described as a 'nearest neighbour' algorithm. Nearest neighbour classification (or 'kNN') refers is a very simple and intuitive family of classification procedures. The training stage is extremely light and in many cases, the classifier - which could for instance be an attribution algorithm - will simply store the examples in memory, without significantly intervening in this data. This is why this family of algorithms is also known as 'memory-based learning', because the classifier predominantly relies on the examples it has stored in memory. In sklearn, such a training phase is extremely easy to set up:"

When confronted with a new test vector, the classifier will scan its memory for a 'nearest neighbour', or the training text, which looks most like the new test item. It determines this nearest neighbour using a distance calculation like the one we implemented ourselves in SciPy in a previous chapter. Next, it _extrapolates_ the class label from this nearest neighbor and attaches the same authorship label to the unseen test instance. Therefore, the distance measure is crucial to the working of a robust kNN-classifier; it can be set in the constructor:"

    "Burrows originally used the Manhattan cityblock distance, which we already came across in this course a couple of times. Importantly, however, Argamon showed that he would scale the relative frequencies of words in texts using the standard deviation of a word's frequency in the entire corpus. Thus, each simple relative frequency in our table needs to be replaced by the ratio of that frequency over the word's standard deviation in this corpus. This scaling method captures the following intuition: in authorship attribution, we are especially interested in high-frequency function words - as you will all know. Therefore, Delta will tune down the weight of words that show a relatively large standard deviation across - and which are probably not function words. Note that this operation is fully unsupervised: we do not need access to the author labels in our training data, to be able to scale our matrixes in this way. Again, in sklearn this is fairly easy to achieve, via the `StandardScaler`. We first import this Scaler and fit in on our data;"

    "Until now, we have been making one major error, since we have been testing our classifier on the same data it was trained on. This is a bad mistake: to evaluate the performance of a classifier, we should really be testing it on out-of-training-data, and see how well it performs on such, previously unseen data. A number of evaluation strategies are available in this respect. One interesting technique is 'leave-one-out' validation: in this setup, we will loop over the available training data; each time we set aside one of the original training samples and we pretend we have never seen it. Then, we fit our classifier on the remaining instances and we apply it to the held-out item. After doing this for all instances, we now get an idea of how well our classifier would do, if it were to be applied to new, unseen documents. Sklearn ships with a lot of interesting functionality for such evaluation procedures and leave-onout validation is one of them:"
